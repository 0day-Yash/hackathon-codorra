Two-Phase Cybersecurity Hackathon

Codorra is a two-phase cybersecurity hackathon where teams build practical, real-world security tools across multiple tracks — from serious defense tech to certified tomfoolery.

Teams of 2–4 participants collaborate to design, build, and demo working security products. Emphasis is on execution over slides, code over cope, and real impact over buzzwords.

After submissions close, projects are reviewed and finalists are shortlisted.

✅ Round 2 — Offline Demo & Judging

Selected teams are invited to Demo Day in Bengaluru or can present virtually.

Each team will:

Give a 3-minute presentation

Demo their project live

Participate in a Q&A with judges

Winners are announced after final evaluations.

👥 Team Formation

Team size: 2–4 members

Open to students, professionals, and independent builders

Mixed backgrounds are welcome

🧩 Tracks (4 Total)

Teams choose one primary track for judging.
Cross-track ideas are explicitly encouraged.

1️⃣ AI + Security

Defensive AI systems, AI-assisted monitoring, model safety, robustness tooling, AI-based physical or digital security.

2️⃣ Network Security

Software, infrastructure, networking tools, protocol security, or physical network security products.

3️⃣ Tomfoolery

Useless, funny, absurd, or meme-tier ideas — but they must work.
Stupid concept ≠ stupid execution.

4️⃣ Open Innovation

Any high-impact security project that doesn’t fit neatly into the above categories.

🛠️ What to Build

Build practical, security-focused tools that solve real problems.

Judges care about:

Working prototypes

Usable features

Clear deployment stories

Technical depth

Slides alone will not save you.

📦 Submission Requirements (Round 1)

All teams must submit:

1️⃣ Devpost Submission

Project title & short description (2–3 sentences)

Selected track

GitHub repository link

Optional: live demo or video

Team member names & roles

2️⃣ GitHub Repository

Must include:

Clean, working code

A detailed README

Setup & usage instructions

Relevant configuration files

Optional demo/test scripts

3️⃣ Demo Readiness

Your project must be demo-ready by Round 2.
A rough but working prototype > a polished Figma fantasy.

🧑‍⚖️ Judging Criteria

Projects are evaluated on:

Idea quality & relevance to cybersecurity

Technical execution & code quality

Presentation clarity

Real-world applicability & impact
