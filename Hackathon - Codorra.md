### **1\. Core Identity & Theme**

* What‚Äôs the *mission*? (Innovation, entrepreneurship, solving India-specific problems, hardcore dev flex, etc.)

The mission is making cool and useful apps, or websites. Plus entrepreneurship when you present the ideas to a judge.

* Is there a central *theme/track* (e.g., AI, fintech, climate-tech, cybersecurity) or fully open?

The theme should be cybersecurity.

* How long is it gonna run? (24h sprint, 48h grind, or 1-week marathon?)

48 hours, in person, full stretch? Also, we need to rethink our strategy in person, it could be like 1000 people, then we need a huge venue, otherwise if theres 100 then we can arrange a wework or something. Depends, can be discussed later.

---

### **2\. Structure & Format**

* Will teams be mandatory, optional, or solo-friendly?

Teams of 3 to 5

* How many participants are we aiming for (in-person vs. online)?

Anything works, at least 100 in person to be profitable, online is unlimited.

* Are submissions judged only by *finished products*, or also by *idea \+ execution \+ presentation*?

idea \+ execution \+ presentation

* Will there be *workshops, talks, and networking* alongside hacking?

Workshops will be there, paid to be a speaker, and networking will be there, over dinner. A general discussion after the hackathon is over, like an unmoderated caucus.

* Online folks: do they compete directly with offline teams, or separate tracks?

Lets decide later once we get an estimate of people.

### **3\. Venue & Infrastructure (Bengaluru)**

* Indoor co-working style or a big auditorium space?

Depends heavily.

* Do we provide **24/7 venue access** (true hackathon energy) or limited hours?

Yes ofc

### **4\. Tech & Submissions**

* What platform are we using for submissions (Devpost, in-house portal, GitHub links)?

Devpost \+ github

No we do not discriminate (I am racist).

---

### **7\. Logistics & Ops**

* Food: Are we feeding them all day (pizza \+ Red Bull clich√©) or sponsorship-based?

Pizza, the 99rs one, twice a day with coffee and if you want something you order it yourself, might get caterers to come there and offer food.
